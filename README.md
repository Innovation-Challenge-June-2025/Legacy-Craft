# Legacy-Craft
Rebuilding trust. Restoring legacy

## Description
Legacy Craft is an initiative to rebuild family legacy lost or threatened by opaque systems, intestate succession, disproportionate taxes, and predatory land speculation. We use the symbolism of blocks to show that every person, every story, and every legal decision matters. This is a project that defends, educates, and empowers, guiding families to reclaim their rights, restore their land, and rebuild trust in their inheritance and in the institutions meant to protect it.
